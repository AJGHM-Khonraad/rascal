This is the core implementation of the Rascal meta-programming language. It contains the interpreter, the parser generator, the parser run-time,
the standard library, the online documentation and the type checker.

Rascal is used in practice, but we consider it to be alpha software because we are still improving the language.

And this branch explores the power of tuples with keyword parameters!
