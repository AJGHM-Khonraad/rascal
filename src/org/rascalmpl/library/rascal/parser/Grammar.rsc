// A grammar is simply a set of productions
data Grammar = grammar(set[Symbol] start, set[Production] productions);

// Here we extend productions with basic combinators allowing to
// construct ordered and un-ordered compositions, and also a difference operator.
//
// The intended semantics are that 
// 		'choice' means unordered choice,
// 		'first'  means ordered choice, where alternatives are tried from left to right,
// 		'diff'   means all alternatives of the first argument are accepted, unless one
// 		         of the alternatives from the right argument are accepted.
//              'assoc'  means all alternatives are acceptible, but nested on the declared side
