Description:

A relation is a set of elements with the following property:

* All elements have the same static tuple type.


Relations are thus nothing more than sets of tuples, but since they are used so often we provide a shorthand notation for them.
Relations are represented by the type `rel[$T_1$ $L_1$, $T_2$ $L_2$, ... ]`, where $T_1$, $T_2$, ... are arbitrary types and
$L_1$, $L_2$, ... are optional labels. It is a shorthand for `set[tuple[$T_1$ $L_1$, $T_2$ $L_2$, ... ]]`.

An n-ary relations with m tuples is denoted by
 `{<$E_11$, $E_12$, ..., $E_1n$>,<$E_21$, $E_22$, ..., $E_2n$>, ..., <$E_m1$, $E_m2$, ..., $E_mn$>}`, 
where the $E_ij$ are expressions that yield the desired element type $T_i$.

Since relations are a form of set all operations on [Set]s are also applicable to relations.


Examples:

<screen>
{<1,10>, <2,20>, <3,30>}
// instead of rel[int,int] we can also give `set[tuple[int,int]]` as type of the above expression
// remember that these types are interchangeable.
{<"a",10>, <"b",20>, <"c",30>}
{<"a", 1, "b">, <"c", 2, "d">}
