Description:
Rigi Standard Format (RSF) is a textual format to represent binary relations and is 
used to exchange relaional facts between different tools. 

An RSF file consists of triples of the form
<listing>
$RelName$ $Elem_1$ $Elem_2$
</listing>
where $RelName$ is the name of a relation and $Elem_1$ and $Elem_2$ are element values.

Examples:
<listing>
call    main          printf  
call    main          listcreate  
data    main          FILE  
data    listcreate    List
</listing>

defines two relations named `call` and `data`.
