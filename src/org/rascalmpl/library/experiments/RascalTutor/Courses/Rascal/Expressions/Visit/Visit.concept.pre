Otherwise, the original value of the subject term is returned.\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n The visit expression is optionally preceded by one of the following strategy indications that \n determine the traversal order of the subject:\n  \<ul\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    top-down\n  \</code\>: visit the subject from root to leaves.\</li\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    top-down-break\n  \</code\>: visit the subject from root to leaves, but stop at the current path when a case matches.\</li\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    bottom-up\n  \</code\>: visit the subject from leaves to root (this is the default).\</li\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    bottom-up-break\n  \</code\>: visit the subject from leaves to root, but stop at the current path when a case matches.\</li\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    innermost\n  \</code\>: repeat a bottom-up traversal as long as the traversal changes the resulting value (compute a fixed-point).\</li\>\n  \<li\> \<code\>\n    outermost\n  \</code\>: repeat a top-down traversal as long as the traversal changes the resulting value (compute a fixed-point).\</li\>\n  \n\</ul\> The execution of the cases has the following effect:\n  \<ul\>\n  \<li\> A PatternWithAction of the form \<code\>\n    \<i\>Pattern\</i\> =\> \<i\>Exp\</i\>\n  \</code\> replaces the current subtree of the subject by the value of \<code\>\n    \<i\>Exp\</i\>\n  \</code\>.  Note that a copy of the subject is created at the start of the visit statement and all replacements are made in this copy. \n   As a consequence, modifcations made during the visit cannot influence matches later on.\n   The modified copy of the subject is ultimately returned by the visit expression.\n  \</li\>\n  \<li\> A PatternWithAction of the form \<code\>\n    \<i\>Pattern\</i\> : \<i\>Statement\</i\>\n  \</code\> executes \<code\>\n    Statement\n  \</code\> and this should lead to one of the following: \<ul\>\n    \<li\> Execution of an Insert statement of the form \<code\>\n      insert \<i\>Exp\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\>\n    \</code\>. The value of \<code\>\n      \<i\>Exp\</i\>\<sub\>2\</sub\>\n    \</code\> replaces the subtree of the subject that is currently being visited. \n     Once again, this modification takes place in a copy of the original subject (see above).\n     Note that:\n     \<ul\>\n      \<li\> An insert statement may only occur in a PatternWithAction in a visit expression or a rule.\</li\>\n      \<li\> \<code\>\n        \<i\>Pattern\</i\> =\> \<i\>Exp\</i\>\n      \</code\> is equivalent to \<code\>\n        \<i\>Pattern\</i\> : insert \<i\>Exp\</i\>;\n      \</code\>.\</li\>\n      \n    \</ul\>\</li\>\n    \<li\> Execution of a \<a href=\"/show?concept=Fail\"\>Fail\</a\> statement: all side effects of \<code\>\n      \<i\>Statement\</i\>\n    \</code\> are undone, no insertion is made, and the next case is tried.\</li\>\n    \<li\> Execution of a \<a href=\"/show?concept=Return\"\>Return\</a\> statement that returns a value from the enclosing function.\</li\>\n    \n  \</ul\>\</li\>\n  \n\</ul\> The precise behaviour of the visit expression depends on the type of the subject:\n  \<ul\>\n  \<li\> For type node or ADT, all nodes of the tree are visited (in the order determined by the strategy).  Concrete patterns and abstract patterns directly match tree nodes. \n   Regular expression patterns match only values of type string.\n  \</li\>\n  \<li\> For other structured types (list, set, map, tuple, rel), the elements of the structured type are visited and  matched against the cases. \n   When inserts are made, a new structured value is created. In these cases a stragegy does not have any effect.\n  \</li\>\n  \n\</ul\>","","","",[])
