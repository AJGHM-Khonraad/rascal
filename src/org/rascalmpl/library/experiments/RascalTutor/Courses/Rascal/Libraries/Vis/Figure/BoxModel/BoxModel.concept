The ingredients are:
* [width] determines the horizontal size.
* [height] determines vertical size.
* [anchor] determines the connection point in figure compositions.
* [hanchor] determines the horizontal position of the anchor and plays a role in the vertical alignment of a figure.
* [vanchor] determines the vertical position of the anchor and plays a role in the horizontal alignment of a figure.


A number of shorthands is provided for common anchor values:


| Shorthand   | Corresponds to     | See                  |
|:------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| `left()`    | `hanchor(0.0)`     | [Properties/left]    |
| `hcenter()` | `hanchor(0.5)`     | [Properties/hcenter] |
| `right()`   | `hanchor(1.0)`     | [Properties/right]   |
| `top()`     | `vanchor(0.0)`     | [Properties/top]     |
| `vcenter()` | `vanchor(0.5)`     | [Properties/vcenter] |
| `bottom()`  | `vanchor(1.0)`     | [Properties/bottom]  |
| `center()`  | `anchor(0.5, 0.5)` | [Properties/center]  |



The following units are used:
