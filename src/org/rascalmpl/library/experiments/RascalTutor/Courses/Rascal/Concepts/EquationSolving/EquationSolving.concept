Synopsis:

Description:
Many problems can be solved by forms of ''constraint solving''. 
This is a declarative way of programming: specify the constraints that a problem solution should 
satisfy and how potential solutions can be generated. 
The actual solution (if any) is found by enumerating solutions and testing their compliance with the constraints.

Rascal provides a [[solve]] statement that helps writing constraint solvers. 

Examples:

A typical example is dataflow analysis where the propagation of values through a program can be described by a set of equations. Their solution can be found with the solve statement. <warning> add links </warning>
