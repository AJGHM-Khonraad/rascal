Synopsis:
int
real
num

Description:
Numbers include integers (values of type <tt>int</tt>) and reals (values of type <tt>real</tt>). If both operands have the same type (<tt>int</tt> or <tt>real</tt>) then the operator is the corresponding operator on integers or reals. Otherwise, integer arguments are first converted to real and the real operator is applied.
