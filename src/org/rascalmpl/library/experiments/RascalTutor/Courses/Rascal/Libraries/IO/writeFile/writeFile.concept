Description:
Write a textual representation of some values to a file:
* If a value is a simple string, the quotes are removed and the contents are de-escaped.
* If a value has a non-terminal type, the parse tree is unparsed to produce a value.
* All other values are printed as-is.
* Each value is terminated by a newline character.
