Function:

# `Figure scale(num perc, Figure fig)`
# `Figure scale(num xperc, num yperc, Figure fig)`
 

Synopsis:

Description:
Scale figure `fig`. When only a single percentage `perc` is given, this applied to
the horizontal and vertical dimension.

When percentages `xperc` and `yperc` are given they are applied to the horizontal, respectively,
vertical dimension.

Examples:
<figure sc1.png>
b = box(size(100,50), fillColor("Blue"));
render(hcat([b, scale(0.5, b), scale(0.25, b), scale(2, b)]));
</figure>
![scale 1](sc1.png)

Benefits:

Pitfalls:
Other properties than dimensions are scaled as well. For instance, lineWidth 
is scaled (as can be seen in the above example). When this effect is undesired,
these properties have to be scaled inversely before `scale` is applied.
Reducing `lineWidth` to 0.5 and scaling by 2 given a `lineWidth` of 1:
<figure sc2.png>
b = box(size(100,50), fillColor("Blue"), lineWidth(0.5));
render(scale(2, b));
</figure>
