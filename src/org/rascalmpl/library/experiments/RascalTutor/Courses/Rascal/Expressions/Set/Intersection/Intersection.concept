Synopsis: Exp1 & Exp2

Description:
If both $Exp1$ and $Exp2$ have a set as value, the result is the intersection of these two set values. If one of $Exp1$ or $Exp2$ does not have a set as value, it is first converted to a set before the intersection is computed.

Examples:
<warning>& seems to miss the case for a non-set argument</warning>

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} & {4, 5, 6};
{1, 2, 3} & 4;
1 & {1, 2, 3, 4};

Questions:

Choice: When you compute the intersection of two sets, the number of elements in the result is always:
b: Greater than the number of elements in both sets.
b: Greater than or equal the number of elements in both sets.
b: Smaller than the number of elements in both sets.
g: Smaller than or equal the number of elements in both sets.
