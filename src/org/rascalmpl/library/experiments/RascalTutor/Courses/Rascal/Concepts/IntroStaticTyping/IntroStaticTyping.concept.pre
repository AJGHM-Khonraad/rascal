concept("IntroStaticTyping",|std:///experiments/RascalTutor/Courses/Rascal/Concepts/IntroStaticTyping/IntroStaticTyping.concept|,[],[],{"Language"},{},"","","","",{}," Rascal is based on static typing, this means that as many errors and inconsistencies as possible are spotted before the program is executed. The types are ordered in a so-called \<i\>type lattice\</i\> shown in the figure.\n \<img class=\"TutorImg\" style=\"float: right;\" width=\"400px\"  title=\"Type Lattice\" alt=\"Type Lattice\" src=\"Courses/Rascal/Concepts/IntroStaticTyping/type-lattice.png\"\>\n \<br/\>\n\<br/\>\n\n The arrows describe a \<i\>subtype-of\</i\> relation between types. The type \<code\>\n  void\n\</code\> is the \<i\>smallest\</i\> type and \n is included in all other types and the type \<code\>\n  value\n\</code\> is the \<i\>largest\</i\> type that includes all other types. \n We also see that \<code\>\n  rel\n\</code\> is a subtype of \<code\>\n  set\n\</code\> and that each ADT is a subtype of \<code\>\n  node\n\</code\>. \n A special role is played by the datatype \<tt\>Tree\</tt\> that is the generic type of syntax trees. \n Syntax trees for specific languages are all subtypes of \<code\>\n  Tree\n\</code\>. As a result, syntax trees can be addressed at two levels: \n \<ul\>\n  \<li\> in a generic fashion as \<code\>\n    Tree\n  \</code\> and,\</li\>\n  \<li\> in a specific fashion as a more precisely typed syntax tree.  Finally, each \<code\>\n    alias\n  \</code\> is structurally equivalent to one or more specific other types.\n  \</li\>\n  \n\</ul\>","","","",[])
