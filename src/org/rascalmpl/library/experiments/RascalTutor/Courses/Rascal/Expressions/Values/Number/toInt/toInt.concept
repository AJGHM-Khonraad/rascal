Synopsis: Function: `int toInt(num n)`

Description:

Convert a number to an integer. If `n` is an integer, this is the identity. If `n` is a real value (implemented as BigDecimal) to an integer (implemented as BigInteger). This conversion is analogous to a narrowing primitive conversion from double to long as defined in the Java Language Specification: any fractional part of this BigDecimal will be discarded. Note that this conversion can loose information about the precision of the BigDecimal value.
