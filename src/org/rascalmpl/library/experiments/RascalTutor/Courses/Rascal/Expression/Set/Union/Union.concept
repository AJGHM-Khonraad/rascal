Synopsis: Exp1 + Exp2

Description:
If both $Exp1$ and $Exp2$ have a set as value, the result is the union of these two set values. If one of $Exp1$ or $Exp2$ does not have a set as value, it is first converted to a set before the union is computed.

Questions:

Choice: When you compute the union of two sets, the number of elements in the result is always:
b: Greater than the number of elements in both sets.
g: Greater than or equal the number of elements in both sets.
b: Smaller than the number of elements in both sets.
b: Smaller than or equal the number of elements in both sets.


Type: <A:set[arb[int,str,real]]> + <B:same[A]>

Value: <A:set[arb[int,str,real]]> + <B:same[A]>

Value:
make: A = set[arb[int,str]]
make: B = same[A]
expr: C = <A> + <B>
hint: <B>
test: <A> + <?> == <C>


Value: <A:set[arb[0,int,str,num,real]]> + <B:same[A]>
