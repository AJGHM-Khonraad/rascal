Synopsis: Exp1 - Exp2

Description:
If both $Exp1$ and $Exp2$ have a set as value, the result is the difference of these two set values. If one of $Exp1$ or $Exp2$ does not have a set as value, it is first converted to a set before the difference is computed.

b: Greater than or equal the number of elements in the first set.
b: Smaller than the number of elements in both sets.
g: Smaller than or equal the number of elements in the first set.
