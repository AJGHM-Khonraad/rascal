Synopsis:

Description:
Rascal is based on static typing, this means that as many errors and inconsistencies as possible are spotted before the program is executed. The types are ordered in a so-called ''type lattice'' shown in the following figure. <br>

<br>
The arrows describe a ''subtype-of'' relation between types. The type <tt>void</tt> is the ''smallest'' type and 
is included in all other types and the type <tt>value</tt> is the ''largest'' type that includes all other types. 
We also see that <tt>rel</tt> is a subtype of <tt>set</tt> and that each ADT is a subtype of <tt>node</tt>. 
A special role is played by the datatype <tt>Tree</tt> that is the generic type of syntax trees. 
Syntax trees for specific languages are all subtypes of Tree. As a result, syntax trees can be addressed at two levels: 
* in a generic fashion as <tt>Tree</tt> and,
* in a specific fashion as a more precisely typed syntax tree. 
Finally, each <tt>alias</tt> is structurally equivalent to one or more specific other types.
