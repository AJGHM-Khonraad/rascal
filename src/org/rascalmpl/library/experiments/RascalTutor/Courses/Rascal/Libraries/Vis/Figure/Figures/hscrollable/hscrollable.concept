Function:
`Figure hscrollable(Figure f, FProperty props ...)`

Synopsis:

Description:

Embeds figure `f` in a scrollable plane. The full height of `f` will always be shown, but if the horizontal space for the hscrollable is too small to show the enitire figure `f` then a horizontal scrollbar will apear. The minimal height of the `hscrollable` is the minimal height of the figure `f` plus the height of a horizontal scrollbar, and the minimal width is the minimal width required to show a horizontal scrollbar (unless the minimal size is specified by [size]).

Also see [scrollable] and [vscrollable].

Examples:

<figure s1.png 250x250>
box1 = box(hsize(2000), fillColor("Blue"));
sb = hscrollable(box1,shrink(0.5));
render(box(sb,fillColor("red")));
</figure>

Pitfalls:

When rendering on-screen the figure is always displayed in a scrollable area. Thus using a scrollable as a toplevel figure makes little sense, as there is no observable difference between `render(hscrollable(g))` and `render(g)`. In both cases horizontal as well as vertical scrollbars may appear.
