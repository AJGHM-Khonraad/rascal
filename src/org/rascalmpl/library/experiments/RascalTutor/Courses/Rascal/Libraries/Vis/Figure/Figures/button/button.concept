Function:
`Figure button(str label, void () vcallback, FProperty props...)`

Synopsis:

Description:
A button with the text `label`. Whenever the user clicks on this button,
callback `vcallback` is called. Typically, the callback causes a state change in the Rascal program
(e.g., the value of a variable is changed) and this variable is used in another part of the figure.

Examples:

<figure b1.png>
public Figure inc(){
  int n = 0;
  return vcat([ button("Increment", void(){n += 1;}),
                text(str(){return "<n>";})
              ]);
}
render(inc());
</figure>
![b1](b1.png)

<warning> no figure dumped</warning>

Clicking the button will increment the value of `n`.

Pitfalls:
Unfortunately we cannot show an interactive version of the above example here.
Try it out in Rascal itself.
