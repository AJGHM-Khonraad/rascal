.Examples

Drawing a red link::{Rascal}#box[] is as simple as this:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(b);
----
and it will look like this:

image::{concept}/b1.png[alt="Box 1"]
 or rather, it will look like this:



image::{concept}/Screenshot1.png[alt="Screenshot 1"]


Wow, the box fills the whole window! So lets give our box a link::{Rascal}#Properties-size[]:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(b);
----
and it will look like this:

image::{concept}/b2.png[alt="Box 2"]


On screen however, it still fills the whole window as shown above.
The lesson here is that size is to be taken as *minimum size* (and probably we should
rename `size` to `minSize` to emphasize this).

So how can we produce a box that does _not_ fill the whole window? The answer is to define the size of the box
_relative_ to its surroundings by using link::{Rascal}#Properties-shrink[]:

[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(b);
----
which says: _ I am a red box and I want to occupy 50% of the available space._ The result is:


image::{concept}/Screenshot2.png[alt="Screen shot 2"]


Shrinking can also be limited to one dimension using link::{Rascal}#Properties-hshrink[] or link::{Rascal}#Properties-vshrink[]:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(b);
----
which says:_ I am a red box and I want to occupy 50% of the available space in the horizontal direction and 100% of the available space in the vertical direction._ The result is:


image::{concept}/Screenshot3.png[alt="Screen shot 3"]


Relative sizes can also be used when figures are nested.

[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(b2);
----

image::{concept}/b5.png[alt="Box 5"]


.Benefits

.Pitfalls

In the above examples we have consistently added the two imports:
[source,rascal]
----
import vis::Figure;
import vis::Render;
----
In other recipes and the Rascal documentation we omit these two imports to avoid cluttering our examples with irrelevant details.
Be aware that you will always need them when creating a visualisation.
