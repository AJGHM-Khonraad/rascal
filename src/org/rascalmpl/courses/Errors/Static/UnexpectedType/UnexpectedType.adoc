.Usage

.Description
This error signals an incompatibility between expected type and actual type.
Some of the situations in which this may occur are
link::{Rascal}#Assert[], link::{Rascal}#Declarations-Variable[], link::{Rascal}#Solve[].

Remedy: adjust the actual type to the expected type.

.Examples
Declaring variable `n` as `int` and assigning it a `str` value gives an error:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>int n = "abc";
[error] Initializer type str not assignable to variable of type int IN 'n = "abc"'
ok
----
The solution is to assign an `int` value to `n`:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>int n = 123;
int: 123
----
An `assert` statement expects an argument of type `bool`:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>assert 3;
[error] Invalid type int, expected expression of type bool
ok
----
