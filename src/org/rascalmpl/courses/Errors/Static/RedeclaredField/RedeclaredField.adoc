.Description
The definition of an link:{RascalLang}#Declarations-AlgebraicDatatype[algebraic data type] consists of a number of constructor functions.
Each constructor has named fields but the same field name may only be used in different constructors
if it has the same type in all occurrences in the declaration.

Remedy: rename one of the fields in the declaration.

.Examples
This is correct since all occurrences of `key` have type `int`:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>data D = d1(int key) | d2(str name, int key);
ok
----
This is incorrect since `key` is used as `int` and as `str`.
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>data D = d1(int key) | d2(str key);
[error] Field key already defined as type int on datatype D, cannot redefine to type str IN 'd2(str key)'
----
This can be corrected by choosing other names for the labels:
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>data D = d1(int intKey) | d2(str strKey);
ok
----

[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
----
A tuple declaration with a duplicate field name also gives an error:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>tuple[int x, str x] Q = <3,"abc">;
[error] Non-well-formed type, labels must be distinct IN 'tuple[int x, str x]'
----
