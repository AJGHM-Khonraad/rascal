.Description

link:{RascalLang}#Values-Location[Locations] provide very flexible ways to access files and external data sources.
There any many protocols (called _schemes_) that can be used (e.g., `file`, `http`, `home` and many others).
This error is generated when an unknown scheme is used.

Remedy: Use an existing scheme.

.Examples
Misspelling the scheme for Rascal's standard library (which is `std`) gives an error when the location is used:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>import IO;
ok
rascal>readFileLines(|standard:///demo/basic/Hello.rsc|);
IO("Unsupported scheme standard")
Call stack (most recent first):
	readFileLines(|standard:///demo/basic/Hello.rsc|, {}) at |std:///IO.rsc|(14929,775,<599,0>,<619,43>)
	main([]) at |test-modules:///ConsoleInput.rsc|(47,49,<4,15>,<4,64>)

ok
----
This is fixed by using the proper scheme name:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>readFileLines(|std:///demo/basic/Hello.rsc|);
