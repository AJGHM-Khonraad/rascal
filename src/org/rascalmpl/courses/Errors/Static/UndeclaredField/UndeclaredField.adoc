This error is generated when a reference is made to an undeclared field.

Remedies:

*  Fix the field name in the reference.
*  Declare a new field as used in the reference.

.Examples
Use of the undeclared field `gender`:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>tuple[str name, int age] Jo = <"Jo", 33>;
tuple[str,int]: <"Jo",33>
rascal>Jo.gender;
[error] Field gender does not exist on type tuple[str name, int age] IN 'Jo.gender'
----
A similar example now expressed as ADT:
[source,rascal-shell-error]
----
rascal>data Person = person(str name, int age);
ok
rascal>jo = person("Jo", 33);
Person: person("Jo",33)
rascal>jo.gender;
[error] Field gender does not exist on type Person IN 'jo.gender'
