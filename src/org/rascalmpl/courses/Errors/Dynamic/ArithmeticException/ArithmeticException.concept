Usage:

Details:

Description:
This error is generated when an illegal arithmetic operation occurs or when
a numeric function  is called with an out-of-range argument.

Remedies:
* Check the validity of the argument before you call the function or apply the operator.
* Catch the `ArithmeticException` yourself, see [Rascal:TryCatch].

Examples:
<screen warnings>
// Division by 0 gives an error:
3/0;
// Giving an out-of-range argument to a mathematical function also gives an error:
import util::Math;
tan(-550000000000000000000000);
// We can also catch the `ArithmeticException` error. First import the Rascal exceptions (which are also included in `Prelude`)
// and `IO`:
import Exception;
import IO;
try println(3/0); catch ArithmeticException(msg): println("The message is: <msg>");
