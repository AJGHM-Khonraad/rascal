[[IO-appendToFile]]
## appendToFile

.Function 
`void appendToFile(loc file, value V...) throws PathNotFound(loc file), IO(str msg)`


.Synopsis
Append a value to a file.

.Description
Append a textual representation of some values to an existing or a newly created file:

*  If a value is a simple string, the quotes are removed and the contents are de-escaped.
*  If a value has a non-terminal type, the parse tree is unparsed to produce a value.
*  All other values are printed as-is.
*  Each value is terminated by a newline character.

.Encoding

The existing file can be stored using any character set possible, if you know the character set, please use <<appendToFileEnc>>.
Else the same method of deciding the character set is used as in <<readFile>>.

.Pitfalls

*  The same encoding pitfalls as the <<readFile>> function.



[[IO-appendToFileEnc]]
## appendToFileEnc

.Function 
`void appendToFileEnc(loc file, str charset, value V...) throws PathNotFound(loc file), IO(str msg)`


.Synopsis
Append a value to a file.

.Description
Append a textual representation of some values to an existing or a newly created file:

*  If a value is a simple string, the quotes are removed and the contents are de-escaped.
*  If a value has a non-terminal type, the parse tree is unparsed to produce a value.
*  All other values are printed as-is.
*  Each value is terminated by a newline character.

Files are encoded using the charset provided.

NOTE: Since `printExp` does no produce a newline after its output, the result prompt `real: 3.14` is glued to the
output of `printExp`.



[[IO-readFile]]
## readFile

.Function 
`str readFile(loc file) throws PathNotFound(loc file), IO(str msg)`


.Synopsis
Read the contents of a location and return it as string value.

.Description
Return the contents of a file location as a single string.
Also see <<readFileLines>>.

.Encoding

A text file can be encoded in many different character sets, most common are UTF8, ISO-8859-1, and ASCII.
If you know the encoding of the file, please use the <<readFileEnc>> and <<readFileLinesEnc>> overloads.
If you do not know, we try to detect this. This detection is explained below:

*  If the implementation of the used scheme in the link:{RascalLang}#Values-Location[location] 
   (e.g.,`|project:///|`) defines the charset of the file then this is used.
*  Otherwise if the file contains a UTF8/16/32 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark[BOM], 
   then this is used.
*  As a last resort the IO library uses heuristics to determine if UTF-8 or UTF-32 could work:
   **  Are the first 32 bytes valid UTF-8? Then use UTF-8.
   **  Are the first 32 bytes valid UTF-32? Then use UTF-32.
*  Finally, we fall back to the system default (as given by the Java Runtime Environment).

*To summarize*, we use UTF-8 by default, except if the link:{rascalLang}#Values-Location[location] has available meta-data, the file contains a BOM, or
the first 32 bytes of the file are not valid UTF-8.

.Pitfalls

*  The second version of `readFile` with a string argument is __deprecated__.
*  In case encoding is not known, we try to estimate as best as we can.
*  We default to UTF-8, if the file was not encoded in UTF-8 but the first characters were valid UTF-8, 
  you might get an decoding error or just strange looking characters.




[[IO-readFileBytes]]
## readFileBytes

.Function 
`list[int] readFileBytes(loc file) throws PathNotFound(loc file), IO(str msg)`


.Synopsis

[[IO-readFileEnc]]
## readFileEnc

.Function 
`str readFileEnc(loc file, str charset) throws PathNotFound(loc file), IO(str msg)`


.Synopsis
Read the contents of a location and return it as string value.

.Description

.Synopsis
Read the contents of a file location and return it as a list of strings.

.Description

Also see <<readFile>>.

.Encoding 

Look at <<readFile>> to understand how this function chooses the character set. If you know the character set used, please use <<readFileLinesEnc>>.

.Pitfalls

*  In case encoding is not known, we try to estimate as best as we can (see [readFile]).
*  We default to UTF-8, if the file was not encoded in UTF-8 but the first characters were valid UTF-8, 
  you might get an decoding error or just strange looking characters (see <<readFile>>).
