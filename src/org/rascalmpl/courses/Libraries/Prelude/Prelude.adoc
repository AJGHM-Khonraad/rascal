:concept: Prelude

.Synopsis
The Rascal standard prelude.

.Description

The `Prelude` library provides core functionality for handling all of Rascal's data-types.
See the link:{RascalLang}[Rascal language reference] for details of the language Rascal itself.

For 

* numeric functions, see the <<Math>> library,
* statistical functions see <<analysis-statistics>>,
* graph functions see <<analysis-graphs>>,
* other common utilitites see <<Libraries-util>>.

`Prelude` provides the following:


** <<Prelude-Boolean,Boolean>>: Library functions for Booleans.
** <<Prelude-DateTime,DateTime>>: Library functions for date and time.
** <<Prelude-Exception,>>: 
** <<Prelude-IO,IO>>: Library functions for input/output.
** <<Prelude-List,List>>: Library functions for lists.
** <<Prelude-ListRelation,ListRelation>>: Library functions for list relations.
** <<Prelude-Map,Map>>: Library functions for maps.
** <<Prelude-Message,Message>>: A `Message` datatype that represents messages in the IDE.
** <<Prelude-Node,Node>>: Library functions for nodes.
** <<Prelude-ParseTree,>>: 
** <<Prelude-Relation,Relation>>: Library functions for relations.
** <<Prelude-Set,Set>>: Library functions for sets.
** <<Prelude-String,String>>: Library functions for strings.
** <<Prelude-Type,>>: 
** <<Prelude-ValueIO,ValueIO>>: Library functions for reading and writing values in textual and binary format.

.Benefits
This library makes it possible to import all core Rascal functionality with a single import.

.Pitfalls

* The prelude may contain more functionality than you need; this leads to an unnecessary longer import 
  and pollution of your name space.

* The precise contents of the prelude are under discussion.

* In the future, Rascal may automatically load the prelude.
