.Synopsis
Justification in [hvcat].

.Syntax


.Types

.Function
`FProperty justify(bool b)`

.Description
If set to `true` then a <<hvcat>> will be rendered "justified". That is instead of aligning the figures in each row to the left or right according to <<ialign>> the horizontal space in each row will be set so that the row fills the complete width. This is the same as the "justified" alignment mode in a word processor.
