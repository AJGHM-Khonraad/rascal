Shrink the current figure relative to the figure it is contained in (its parent).

Note that:

*  `shrink(hvs)` defines the shrink in both dimensions and is equivalent to `hshrink(hvs), vshrink(hvs)`.
*  `shrink(hs, vs)` defines the shrink in both dimensions separately and is equivalent to `hshrink(hs), vshrink(vs)`.
