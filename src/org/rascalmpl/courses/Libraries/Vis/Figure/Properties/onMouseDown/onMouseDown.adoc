.Synopsis

.Syntax

.Function
`FProperty onMouseDown(bool (int, map[KeyModifier,bool]) cb)`

.Description
`onMouseDown` has a single argument: a callback `cb` that gets two arguments:

*  an `int` indicating the mouse button, 1 indicates left mouse button, 2 the middle and 3 the right. Higher numbers are used for mice with more buttons.
* an `map[KeyModifier,bool]` indicating which keyboard modifiers are currently pressed. See [KeyModifier].


The callback returns a `bool` which indicates if the event is captured. Mouse handlers are executed deepest-figure first, if the mouse press is captured then the mouse press is not propagated further so figures below (less deep than) this figure will not receive a mouse press.
