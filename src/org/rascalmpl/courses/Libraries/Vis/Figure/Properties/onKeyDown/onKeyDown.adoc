.Synopsis

Define interactive behaviour when a key is pressed.

.Syntax

.Types

.Function
FProperty onKeyDown (bool (KeySym key, map[KeyModifier,bool] modifiers) cb)

.Description
This property allows you to install a handler for key presses. When the mouse is over the figure (i.e. the figure has focus) and a key is pressed then the callback `cb` will be called. This callback takes two arguments

*  `KeySym key` the key that is pressed, described by a [KeySym].
*  `map[KeyModifier,bool]` a map that indicates which modifier keys (Control, Alt, Super) are currently held down. Modifier keys are described by [KeyModifier].

The callback returns a `bool` which indicates if the event is captured. Keyhandlers are executed deepest-figure first, if the key press is captured then the key press is not propagated further so figures below (less deep) than this figure will not receive a key press.
