.Function
`Figure hvcat(Figures figs, FProperty props...)`

.Description
Horizontal and vertical composition of a list of figures within a given width 
comparable to the horizontal and vertical placement of words in a paragraph of text.

Figures are placed horizontally as long as they fit within the given width.
If a figure would exceed that width it is placed on the next row of figures.

Within each row, the horizontal gap controls the distance between figures and the vertical alignment of each figure controls
its alignment in the row.

The distance between rows is controlled by the vertical gap.

.Examples
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(hvcat([b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6], gap(5)));
----
displayed in a 400x50 area gives: 
image::{concept}/h1.png[alt="h1"]


However, the same example
[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(hvcat([b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6], gap(5)));
----

The alignment of the rows can be set using <<justify>> and <<ialign>>.
