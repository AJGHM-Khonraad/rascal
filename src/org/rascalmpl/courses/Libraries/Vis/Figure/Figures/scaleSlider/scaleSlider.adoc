# scaleSlider
:concept: Vis/Figure/Figures/scaleSlider

.Synopsis
Interactive slider.

.Syntax

.Types

.Function
`Figure scaleSlider(int() low, int high(), int () selection, void(int) callback)`

.Description
Create an interactive slider that can be used to interactively control an integer parameter.
The arguments are as follows:

*  `low`: function to determine lowest value on the scale.
*  `high` function to determine highest value on the scale.
*  `selection`: function to determine currently selected value.
*  `callback`: function called when slider is changed.

.Examples
We now use the `scaleSlider` to interactively control the size of a box.
Observe that:

*  the local variable `n` is used to record the current size of the box.
*  the arguments of `scaleSlider` use or modify the value of `n`.
*  the last element in the vertical composition uses `computeFigure`
  to compute a new box of size `n`.


Here are the code and the resulting figure:

[source,rascal-shell]
----
rascal>render(scaledbox());  
----

Moving the slider will change the size of the box.      

.Benefits

.Pitfalls
Due to limitations in SWT this does not behave correctly when being placed over or under figures, so do not use them in <<overlay>> or <<mouseOver>>.

Unfortunately we cannot show an interactive version of the above example here.
Try it out in Rascal itself.
