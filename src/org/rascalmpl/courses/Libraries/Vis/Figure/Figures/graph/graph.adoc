.Synopsis
Graph layout.

.Syntax

.Types

.Function
`Figure graph(Figures nodes, list[Edge] edges, FProperty props...)`

.Description
Takes a list of nodes and a list of edges and draws a graph. 
The nodes can be arbitrary figures that should have a name (using the <<id>> property). 
The edges determine connections between named nodes. 

The following constraints apply:

*  All nodes should have an id property with a unique value.
*  All edges should refer to ids that are defined by the nodes.


The following properties are applicable to graphs:

*  [id] to define the identity of nodes and to define edges between nodes.
*  [hint] determines the layout algorithm to use. Currently, only `"layered"` is supported.
*  [layer] is used to define the placement of nodes in the same layer.
*  [orientation] is used to define the drawing direction.
*  [toArrow] and [fromArrow] are used to define arrows on edges.
*  [$Properties/label] defines an edge label.

.Examples

----
rascal>render(graph(nodes, edges, hint("layered"), gap(100)));

.Benefits

.Pitfalls

*  The layered graph layout performs currently best when:
**  the [hgap] is set to a value equal to the average width of the nodes.
**  [orientation] is not used.

*  For spring layout the following do not yet work:
**  labels,
**  arrows.
