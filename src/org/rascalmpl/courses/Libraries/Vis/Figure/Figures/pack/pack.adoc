.Function
`Figure pack(Figures figs, FProperty props...)`

.Description
Pack the given figures in arbitrary order to fill space as efficiently as possible.
Our bin packing algorithm is inspired by http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/[LightMaps].

The size computation is automatic and attempts to obtain a rectangular image close to a square.
The gap property is used for the distance between figures.

When the vertical size available is too small, a vertical scrollbar will appear. 

.Examples
