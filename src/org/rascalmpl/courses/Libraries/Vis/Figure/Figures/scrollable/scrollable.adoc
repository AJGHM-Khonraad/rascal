.Function
`Figure scrollable(Figure f, FProperty props ...)`

.Benefits

.Pitfalls
When rendering on-screen the figure is always displayed in a scrollable area. Thus using a scrollable as a top level figure makes little sense, as there is no observable difference between `render(scrollable(g))` and `render(g)`.
