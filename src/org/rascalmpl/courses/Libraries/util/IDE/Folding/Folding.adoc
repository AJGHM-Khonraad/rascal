[[IDE-Folding]]
# Folding
:concept: util/IDE/Folding

.Synopsis
Editors may hide (fold) certain parts of a source text based on `foldable` annotations.

.Syntax

#  `syntax $Name$ = @foldable $Symbols$;`
#  `a@foldable = true`

.Types

.Function

.Description

There exist two ways of manipulating the folding behavior:

#  By statically tagging a [SyntaxDefinition] with `@foldable`, any source text that is covered by a [ParseTree] 
  generated from this definition will be foldable.
#  By dynamically annotating a [ParseTree] with the `foldable` annotation (set to `true`) a similar effect is obtained.
